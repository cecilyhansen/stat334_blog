This blog highlights skills I have learned about data visualization throughout the Stat 334 course. It shows my knowledge of appropriate plot usage for categorical and quantitative data. It also demonstrates my skill with changing themes, aesthetics, geoms, coordinates, facets, and more in order to effectively present the data I am working with.

It shows that “Back in Action” was the most viewed movie so far, with over 1.6 billion views globally. The action-comedy film was released in 2025 and stars Jamie Foxx and Cameron Diaz. This was surprising to me, because I personally hadn’t seen it or haven’t heard it. However, it clearly led the charts in the first half of 2025. Almost all of the films in the top 15 were action, thrillers, or comedy. “Leo” was the only film marketed specifically towards children. It’s definitely clear that certain genres dominate the most viewed films on Netflix.\n\nmost_popular_movies &lt;- movies |&gt;\n  filter(report == \"2025Jan-Jun\") |&gt;\n  arrange(desc(hours_viewed)) |&gt;\n  slice(1:15) |&gt;\n  select(title, views, available_globally)\n\nggplot(data = most_popular_movies, aes(x = views, y = reorder(title, views))) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = views, x = 0, yend = title), color = \"darkgreen\") +\n  geom_point(color = \"darkgreen\" ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Views\", y = \"Movie Title\", title = \"Most Viewed Movies on Netflix in 2025\") \n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 2 - Difference in Average Viewing Hours\nI made an error bar plot to show the difference in average viewing hours between films that are globally available and not. Globally available films are able to be watched around the world, while others may be restricted to certain regions. I took the average viewing hours between the two groups, and calculated the standard error to make my plot. It showed that globally available movies were viewed much more frequently than locally restricted ones. This was expected, but I was surpised that there was no overlap.\n\nmovies_2 &lt;- movies |&gt;\n  group_by(available_globally) |&gt;\n  filter(!is.na(views)) |&gt;  \n  summarize(\n    mean_hours = mean(hours_viewed),\n    se = sd(hours_viewed) / sqrt(n())\n) |&gt;\n  mutate(se_lb = mean_hours - se,\n         se_ub = mean_hours + se)\n\nggplot(data = movies_2, aes(x = available_globally, y = mean_hours)) +\n geom_point() +\n  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = se_lb, ymax = se_ub)) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Available Globally\", y = \"Average Hours Viewed\", title = \"Difference in Average Viewing Hours in 2025 for Globally Available and Regional Movies\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 3 - Impact of Release Date on Number of Views\nThis plot shows that films watched in 2025 were more frequently released in 2025 instead of prior years. Movies that were released before 2020 had lower views than films released in 2025. This makes sense because people are more likely to watch new releases. However, even older films still had millions of views. Many people enjoy rewatching their favorite movies. The highest views are definitely skewed toward the 2025 releases.\n\nggplot(data = movies, aes(x = release_date, y = views)) +\n  geom_col() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Release Date\", y = \"Views\", title = \"Movie views in 2025 based on when they were released\")\n\nWarning: Removed 29396 rows containing missing values or values outside the scale range\n(`geom_col()`)."

    "text": "Conclusion\nIf I had more time to look at this data, I think it would be interesting to add a spatial aspect to my analysis. It would be interesting to look at a specific movie and see how many views it got in every country. It would also be interesting to separate the data by specific genres to see which genres get the most views on average. It could also be interesting to compare Netflix movies with movies on different streaming services. It’s possible that action and comedy movies are the most popular on Netflix, but different genres like horror or drama might be more popular on HBO. Similarly, children’s movies might be more popular on Disney+. My visualizations connect to class because I used the information I learned about geoms, aesthetics, variability, and themes to make my plots. For my second visualization especially, I utilized the information we learned about standard error to make my error bar plot. I believe my plots do a good job of representing the points I made about movies on Netflix."

The data shows that heat and rain & flooding are the two most prevalent extreme weather events that are studied, followed by droughts and storms. We can infer from this that these are the weather events that are of the most concern to researchers. This makes sense because extreme flooding, as well as extreme heat and drought, can be detrimental to humans. These events can cause significant damage to property, agriculture, and cause loss of life. It is interesting to think about what weather events are the most studied and why. Floods and heat are dangerous and costly for humans, but how does the rest of the natural world react?\n\nnew &lt;- attribution_studies|&gt;\n  group_by(event_type) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    count = n()\n  )\n\nggplot(data = new, aes(x = count, y = event_type)) +\n  geom_segment(aes(xend = count, x = 0, yend = event_type)) +\n  geom_point() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Count\", y = \"Event type\", title = \"Extreme events represented in attribution studies\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nVisualization 2\nMy second graph is a bar plot looking at what regions of the world attribution studies are focused on. The most studied regions are North America, Europe, and eastern/south-eastern Asia. However, North American and European countries are not the places where the most extreme weather events occur. They likely have the most attribution studies because they are the most well-funded to conduct research. In fact, the Global South is much more vulnerable to extreme weather. Undeveloped nations are often the most severely affected - countries like Haiti or the Philippines are prone to intense storms that have only worsened with human-driven climate change. This bar plot actually represents a major gap in the scientific field of extreme weather attribution. It is crucial that research is expanded to include the regions where global climate change is hitting the hardest, so we can understand more about just how much humans are changing the climate.\n\nattribution_studies |&gt;\n  group_by(cb_region) |&gt;\n  summarize(\n    count = n()\n  ) |&gt;\n  ggplot(aes(x = cb_region, y = count)) +\n  geom_col(fill = \"skyblue\") + \n  coord_flip() +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(x = \"Region\", y = \"Count\", title = \"Attribution studies in different regions\")"

It would be interesting to see if there is an inverse relationship between climate change affects and number of attribution studies. It would also be interesting to observe this data set over time and see if it changes. This was a limited approach to think about extreme weather and there are many more ways to think about it than just attribution studies. However, it is representative of the inequalities present in climate change research. My visualizations connect to class because I utilized the appropriate plots to represent categorical data - lollipop plots and bar plots. I also utilized different grammar of graphics idea by changing the coordinates, geoms, and themes to make my plots visually appealing. I believe that they are representative of the points I am trying to make."
